# About

Many Zeros addresses are smart contract addresses you can deploy your code to using create 3.
They are mined first and tokenized as ERC-721 tokens when you buy one. Once you obtained an address on _Ethereum_,
only you can claim this same address accross Layer 2 chains enabling you to have the **same smart contract
address across multiple chains**.
