# How do you find vanity addresses?

Generating vanity addresses with a specific structure such as leading zeros requires randomly generating many addresses to find the one that matches the desired pattern, effectively bruteforcing the address parameters. This is a computationally expensive process that's parallelized on GPUs to reduce cost.
Once found we collect the parameters in our database, offering a trustless purchase permit that you can redeem for ETH in the contract.
