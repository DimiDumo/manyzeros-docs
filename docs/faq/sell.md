# Can I sell addresses I've mined myself?

We currently don't have functionality to support 3rd party sellers, if you'd like to organize a 3rd
party sale you can simply mint the address in question as a token and create an offer on any NFT platform
as the address tokens are fully ERC721 compatible.
